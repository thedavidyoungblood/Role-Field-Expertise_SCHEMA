Using the formula:

[Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Field/Area of Expertise] + [Role Core/Position Core]

Here are 5 examples:

Chief Financial Officer:
Chief = Role Prefix/Position Prefix
Financial = Field/Area of Expertise
Officer = Role Core/Position Core

Senior Marketing Manager:
Senior = Role Prefix/Position Prefix
Marketing = Field/Area of Expertise
Manager = Role Core/Position Core

Executive Product Director:
Executive = Role Prefix/Position Prefix
Product = Field/Area of Expertise
Director = Role Core/Position Core

Assistant Technology Coordinator:
Assistant = Role Prefix/Position Prefix
Technology = Field/Area of Expertise
Coordinator = Role Core/Position Core

General Operations Supervisor:
General = Role Prefix/Position Prefix
Operations = Field/Area of Expertise
Supervisor = Role Core/Position Core

So, revisiting the formula:

"Chief" could be termed as a "Role Prefix" or "Position Prefix."
"Officer," "Manager," "Director," etc., could be termed as the "Role Core" or "Position Core."
Thus, the formula could be:

[Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Field/Area of Expertise] + [Role Core/Position Core]

The order of operations in the formula can vary based on cultural, organizational, or industry-specific conventions. Here are some scenarios where the order might differ:

Field/Area of Expertise Comes First: In some industries or cultures, the area of expertise or specialization might be emphasized before the role.

Example: "Financial Chief Officer" instead of "Chief Financial Officer."
Formula: [Field/Area of Expertise] + [Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Role Core/Position Core]
Role Core Comes Before Field/Area of Expertise: In some titles, the core role might be mentioned before specifying the area of expertise.

Example: "Manager Operations" instead of "Operations Manager."
Formula: [Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Role Core/Position Core] + [Field/Area of Expertise]
Absence of Role Prefix: Not all titles will have a prefix. Some might just directly start with the core role or the field of expertise.

Example: "Engineer Software" or "Software Engineer."
Formula: [Role Core/Position Core] + [Field/Area of Expertise] or [Field/Area of Expertise] + [Role Core/Position Core]
Compound Fields: Some titles might have compound fields of expertise, where two areas of expertise are combined.

Example: "Chief Research & Development Officer."
Formula: [Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Compound Field/Area of Expertise] + [Role Core/Position Core]
Suffixes or Additional Descriptors: Some titles might have additional descriptors that come after the core role.

Example: "Engineer Software Senior" or "Software Engineer Senior."
Formula: [Role Core/Position Core] + [Field/Area of Expertise] + [Descriptor/Suffix]
Conjunctions Within the Title: Some titles might have conjunctions that aren't just linking the core role to the field but are integral to the title itself.

Example: "Director of Research and Development."
Formula: [Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Role Core/Position Core] + [Conjunction] + [Compound Field/Area of Expertise]


It's essential to note that while these formulas provide a structured way to understand and categorize job titles, real-world usage can vary widely based on specific organizational preferences, industry norms, and regional or cultural conventions.

Examples:
[Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Field/Area of Expertise] + [Role Core/Position Core]
[Role Prefix/Position Prefix] + [Role Core/Position Core] + [Conjunction] + [Compound Field/Area of Expertise]
